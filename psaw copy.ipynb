No no no, cases are being dismissed cause judges in this Country are as corrupt as Congress (including Trump’s SCOTUS appointments I’m including as well) there is overwhelming evidence of Trump’s Victory being stolen from him. But don’t worry, some Senator and some Representative will object to the results and will throw us in a contingent election and House of Delegations will give Trump his rightful win since House of Delegations are Republican Majority. And if all else fails, there will be another Revolution like our Founding Fathers had and overthrow the entire government if we have to. Biden didn’t win, he stole the presidency.\\n\\nTrump was winning by a HUGE landslide in all of the states including the swing states then they unprecedentedly paused all counting and then the next day, the found enough fraudulent ballots to overturn Trump’s lead. Sorry, that doesn’t pass the sniff test.\\n\\nWe have VIDEO Evidence of Ballot Stuffing via pulling out suit cases and suitcases full of ballots just pulled out from under the table after they kicked out the Republican Poll Watchers. Sorry, that doesn’t pass the sniff test.\\n\\nThen you have millions and millions of ballots just dumped in the middle of the night while we were all sleeping all of the Mail in Ballots were 100% for Biden and ZERO for Trump. Now if there wasn’t fraud involved, those Mail in Ballots may it be 20%, 30% or even 40% of those ballots would be for Trump. Yeah, you could say “bUt tRuMp tOld hiS suPpOrTeRs tO vOtE iN pErSoN” here is why that argument is false. Us Trump Supporters, we have a mind of our own, we make our own choices regardless of what we’re told to do. That said, many Trump Supporters DID vote by Mail. But as the Democrat Whistleblower told Breitbart News is that Mail In Voting IS the Democrats Plan to steal the Election and he gave this example. Say you have a Anti-Trump Post Master or a Democrat Post Master in a Republican District and knowing 95% of Ballots are going to Trump and Republicans, that post master could take those ballots and throw them in the Garbage, or in the Shredder or in a Creek Bed somewhere never to be counted.

No no no, cases are being dismissed cause judges in this Country are as corrupt as Congress (including Trump’s SCOTUS appointments I’m including as well) there is overwhelming evidence of Trump’s Victory being stolen from him. But don’t worry, some Senator and some Representative will object to the results and will throw us in a contingent election and House of Delegations will give Trump his rightful win since House of Delegations are Republican Majority. And if all else fails, there will be another Revolution like our Founding Fathers had and overthrow the entire government if we have to. Biden didn’t win, he stole the presidency.\\n\\nTrump was winning by a HUGE landslide in all of the states including the swing states then they unprecedentedly paused all counting and then the next day, the found enough fraudulent ballots to overturn Trump’s lead.

Now if there wasn’t fraud involved, those Mail in Ballots may it be 20%, 30% or even 40% of those ballots would be for Trump. Yeah, you could say “bUt tRuMp tOld hiS suPpOrTeRs tO vOtE iN pErSoN” here is why that argument is false.

But as the Democrat Whistleblower told Breitbart News is that Mail In Voting IS the Democrats Plan to steal the Election and he gave this example. Say you have a Anti-Trump Post Master or a Democrat Post Master in a Republican District and knowing 95% of Ballots are going to Trump and Republicans, that post master could take those ballots and throw them in the Garbage, or in the Shredder or in a Creek Bed somewhere never to be counted.

      "comment(body=' Hari: \\n \\n&gt; when the Kurds rebelled against British rule, he said: \"I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes...[It] would spread a lively terror.\"\\n \\n Both Miton (Graun) and he are selectively quoting from an inter departmental minute that Churchill, as War Secretary, wrote on 12th May 1919 The full memo is as follows:\\n \\n&gt; I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of gas retention as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas.  \\n \\n&gt;&gt; I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on those affected.\\n \\nUncivilised tribes was an official term as per the British Manual of Military and this and similar terms were used by scholars of international law: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2189127\\n \\nHere is how Milton describes the weapon used:\\n \\n&gt; But in the final months of the first world war, scientists at the governmental laboratories at Porton in Wiltshire developed a far more devastating weapon: the top secret \"M Device\", an exploding shell containing a highly toxic gas called diphenylaminechloroarsine.  The man in charge of developing it, Major General Charles Foulkes, called it \"the most effective chemical weapon ever devised\".  \\n&gt;&gt; Trials at Porton suggested that it was indeed a terrible new weapon. Uncontrollable vomiting, coughing up blood and instant, crippling fatigue were the most common reactions. The overall head of chemical warfare production, Sir Keith Price, was convinced its use would lead to the rapid collapse of the Bolshevik regime. \"If you got home only once with the gas you would find no more Bolshies this side of Vologda.  \\n \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A staggering 50,000 M Devices were shipped to Russia: British aerial attacks using them began on 27 August 1919, targeting the village of Emtsa, 120 miles south of Archangel. Bolshevik soldiers were seen fleeing in panic as the green chemical gas drifted towards them. Those caught in the cloud vomited blood, then collapsed unconscious.\\n \\nA misleading impression is thus given as to the effects of the M-Device and the circumstances surrounding its employment by the British. \\n \\nMilton is correct that the M-Device contained diphenylaminechloroarsine. This was a variant of the diphenylchlorarsine (DA) which the Germans had used against the British from July 1917 onwards.\\n \\nMilton however neglects to mention that the Bolsheviks were the first ones to use chemical warfare. On the 27th of January Major Gilmore, forward commander around Emptsa river, reported that the Red Army had used gas shells against his troops. Ironside, the C-in-C at Archangel, informed the War Office of this development.\\n \\nThe Bolsheviks usage of chemical weaponry had been on a small scale but it justified retaliation in kind. On 7th February 1919 Churchill instructed Ironside, C-in-C at Archangel, that the kid gloves were to come off:\\n \\n&gt; Fullest use is now to be made of gas shell with your forces, or supplied by us to Russian forces, as Bolsheviks have been using gas shells against Allied troops at Archangel.\\n \\nOn 26th April 1919 50,000 M-Devices were ordered shipped to Russia and they were despatched on 10th May 1919.\\n \\nMilton’s description of the weapon would easily lead one to think that this was a lethal agent, after all how else would it clear “this side of the Vologda” of Bolsheviks? Milton doesn’t mention that DM is a non-lethal agent. Moreover, while Sir Keith Price, the head of Chemical Warfare Production at the Ministry of Munitions, did say that if used the M-Device would mean no more Bolsheviks “on this side of the Vologda” he also emphasised that DM merely incapacitated, it did not kill.What Sir Keith actually said was: \\n \\n&gt; If there is going to be a White Sea campaign, do not let the powers that be overlook the new gas generators. I really believe they are the most deadly weapon which has yet been produced, and in my opinion they can quite conveniently be used in North Russia being very handy and portable. **The D.M. generator knocks people out for say 48 hours but does not kill them,** the D.A. kills alright \\\\[it doesn’t, see below\\\\]; which is the right medicine for the Bolshevist I don’t know. I know the Archangel district pretty well and the kind of country we shall have to fight in, and you may take it that artillery is not likely to be much good as there is far too much forest; but gas would I think drift along very nicely, and certainly put the wind up someone. I believe if you got home only once with the gas you would find no more Bolshies this side \\\\[i.e. north\\\\] of the Vologda.  \\\\[emphasis added\\\\]\\n \\nIn fact, Sir Keith was wrong about DA; it is not lethal. DA – or diphenylchlorarsine – was a chemical extracted from, coal tar derivative used in the dye industry. The Germans used it against the British from July 1917 onwards, sparking British research in the substance and then the development of DM. JBS Haldane described the symptoms of being affected by DA thus:\\n \\n&gt; The pain in the head is described as like that caused when fresh water gets into the nose when bathing, but infinitely more severe…. Accompanied by the most appalling mental distress and misery Some soldiers… had to be prevented from committing suicide; others temporarily went raving mad, and tried to burrow into the ground to escape from imaginary pursuers. **And yet within forty-eight hours the large majority had recovered, and practically none became permanent invalids** \\\\[Emphasis added\\\\]\\n \\nBritish troops handled M-Devices were advised that if they inhaled the chemical they should smoke a cigarette for relief!\\n \\n Milton’s description of the effect of use of M-Devices in action is also inaccurate. They were first used on the 27th August 1919 against Emtsa Station. However, those affected did not “vomit blood” then collapse into unconsciousness. That would have been a severe reaction to DM, not the usual one. Under interrogation a captured Red Army soldier, Pt. Kashevnikoff, informed the British (after he had surrendered) that the DM used against Emtsa station caused his eyes to water, gave him a headache and a bad cough. He was unable to walk properly as if he were inebriated. Pt.

Col. Thom was unable to verify claims that the weapon had actually killed anyone.', created_utc=1604836231, created=1604816431.0, d_={'body': ' Hari: \\n \\n&gt; when the Kurds rebelled against British rule, he said: \"I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes...[It] would spread a lively terror.\"\\n \\n Both Miton (Graun) and he are selectively quoting from an inter departmental minute that Churchill, as War Secretary, wrote on 12th May 1919 The full memo is as follows:\\n \\n&gt; I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of gas retention as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas.  \\n \\n&gt;&gt; I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on those affected.\\n \\nUncivilised tribes was an official term as per the British Manual of Military and this and similar terms were used by scholars of international law: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2189127\\n \\nHere is how Milton describes the weapon used:\\n \\n&gt; But in the final months of the first world war, scientists at the governmental laboratories at Porton in Wiltshire developed a far more devastating weapon: the top secret \"M Device\", an exploding shell containing a highly toxic gas called diphenylaminechloroarsine.  The man in charge of developing it, Major General Charles Foulkes, called it \"the most effective chemical weapon ever devised\".  \\n&gt;&gt; Trials at Porton suggested that it was indeed a terrible new weapon. Uncontrollable vomiting, coughing up blood and instant, crippling fatigue were the most common reactions. The overall head of chemical warfare production, Sir Keith Price, was convinced its use would lead to the rapid collapse of the Bolshevik regime. \"If you got home only once with the gas you would find no more Bolshies this side of Vologda.  \\n \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A staggering 50,000 M Devices were shipped to Russia: British aerial attacks using them began on 27 August 1919, targeting the village of Emtsa, 120 miles south of Archangel. Bolshevik soldiers were seen fleeing in panic as the green chemical gas drifted towards them. Those caught in the cloud vomited blood, then collapsed unconscious.\\n \\nA misleading impression is thus given as to the effects of the M-Device and the circumstances surrounding its employment by the British. \\n \\nMilton is correct that the M-Device contained diphenylaminechloroarsine. This was a variant of the diphenylchlorarsine (DA) which the Germans had used against the British from July 1917 onwards.\\n \\nMilton however neglects to mention that the Bolsheviks were the first ones to use chemical warfare. On the 27th of January Major Gilmore, forward commander around Emptsa river, reported that the Red Army had used gas shells against his troops. Ironside, the C-in-C at Archangel, informed the War Office of this development.\\n \\nThe Bolsheviks usage of chemical weaponry had been on a small scale but it justified retaliation in kind. On 7th February 1919 Churchill instructed Ironside, C-in-C at Archangel, that the kid gloves were to come off:\\n \\n&gt; Fullest use is now to be made of gas shell with your forces, or supplied by us to Russian forces, as Bolsheviks have been using gas shells against Allied troops at Archangel.\\n \\nOn 26th April 1919 50,000 M-Devices were ordered shipped to Russia and they were despatched on 10th May 1919.\\n \\nMilton’s description of the weapon would easily lead one to think that this was a lethal agent, after all how else would it clear “this side of the Vologda” of Bolsheviks? Milton doesn’t mention that DM is a non-lethal agent. Moreover, while Sir Keith Price, the head of Chemical Warfare Production at the Ministry of Munitions, did say that if used the M-Device would mean no more Bolsheviks “on this side of the Vologda” he also emphasised that DM merely incapacitated, it did not kill.What Sir Keith actually said was: \\n \\n&gt; If there is going to be a White Sea campaign, do not let the powers that be overlook the new gas generators. I really believe they are the most deadly weapon which has yet been produced, and in my opinion they can quite conveniently be used in North Russia being very handy and portable. **The D.M. generator knocks people out for say 48 hours but does not kill them,** the D.A. kills alright \\\\[it doesn’t, see below\\\\]; which is the right medicine for the Bolshevist I don’t know. I know the Archangel district pretty well and the kind of country we shall have to fight in, and you may take it that artillery is not likely to be much good as there is far too much forest; but gas would I think drift along very nicely, and certainly put the wind up someone. I believe if you got home only once with the gas you would find no more Bolshies this side \\\\[i.e. north\\\\] of the Vologda.  \\\\[emphasis added\\\\]\\n \\nIn fact, Sir Keith was wrong about DA; it is not lethal. DA – or diphenylchlorarsine – was a chemical extracted from, coal tar derivative used in the dye industry. The Germans used it against the British from July 1917 onwards, sparking British research in the substance and then the development of DM. JBS Haldane described the symptoms of being affected by DA thus:\\n \\n&gt; The pain in the head is described as like that caused when fresh water gets into the nose when bathing, but infinitely more severe…. Accompanied by the most appalling mental distress and misery Some soldiers… had to be prevented from committing suicide; others temporarily went raving mad, and tried to burrow into the ground to escape from imaginary pursuers. **And yet within forty-eight hours the large majority had recovered, and practically none became permanent invalids** \\\\[Emphasis added\\\\]\\n \\nBritish troops handled M-Devices were advised that if they inhaled the chemical they should smoke a cigarette for relief!\\n \\n Milton’s description of the effect of use of M-Devices in action is also inaccurate. They were first used on the 27th August 1919 against Emtsa Station. However, those affected did not “vomit blood” then collapse into unconsciousness. That would have been a severe reaction to DM, not the usual one. Under interrogation a captured Red Army soldier, Pt. Kashevnikoff, informed the British (after he had surrendered) that the DM used against Emtsa station caused his eyes to water, gave him a headache and a bad cough. He was unable to walk properly as if he were inebriated. Pt. Kashevnikoff said that around 30 of his comrades were affect but none were either killed or even hospitalised.\\n \\nDeputy Director of Medical Services, Col.

It is truly disgusting and depressing to see people so happy to re-elect someone who can sleep at night with all the blood on his hands. A Biden presidency is the actual moment that America lost its way. By going BACK to a regime of war instead of trying something new.
